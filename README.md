# manyToMany

This is a demo-project that has been setup to reproduce and better analyse a bug while using a selfreferencing annotation @ManyToMany.

The problem has been described here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72733303/self-referencing-manytomany-relationship-not-updating?noredirect=1#comment128498793_72733303

This is a spring-boot project, ready to start. 
When starting the project, testcases defined in TestCaseXmlReaderMock.class are automatically imported in a h2-DB.
